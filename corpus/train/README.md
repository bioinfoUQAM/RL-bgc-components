Training fungal BGC datasets can be obtained at [this repository](https://github.com/bioinfoUQAM/fungalbgcdata), including the [balanced dataset](https://github.com/bioinfoUQAM/fungalbgcdata/raw/master/pos50neg50.zip) used for all experiments.
Training files in the `/train` folder of the fungal BGC datasets should be extracted to the `/corpus/train` folder. 

----------------------------

Provided in `/corpus/train` are sample training files (*.domains).
The sample *.domains files have a similar format to FASTA files, and consist of the region ID, and the protein domains extracted from BGC and candidate BGC amino acid sequences using [PfamScan](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/pfa/pfamscan/).
